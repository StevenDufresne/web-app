## Similar Applications

- [Organizer / Organizer HD](http://www.aesthology.com/organizer/)

	Allows users to schedule events and store multiple pieces of data including Geolocation. Can manage daily schedule, to-do lists and create diagrams.
	
	**Differences**
	
	My app focuses more on connecting users instead of having two independent schedules. 

- [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com/)

	Connects users via email. Allows users to connect to friends and create events.
	
	**Differences**
	
	My app provides a more visual approach to the scheduling app. I Have Plans tries to shorten the process and makes event creation a 2 minute process. Moreover, I will use geolocation to help users find locations to meet.

- [Scheduling](http://schedulingapp.com/)

	This app focuses primarily on scheduling events that occur during the day. It used more in an effort to improve multi-tasking. It allows the users to set schedules and input other people schedules into the database. Suitable for coordinators and other employment related positions. This is a pay per service application.
	
	**Differences**
	
	Again, the focus of my app is on filling in the 'pleasure zones' in users's schedule. Work related schedules have no importance in my application. Further, my free app helps to connect users instead of creating a personal schedule related environment.

## User research

I Have Plans is targeted at stay at home moms and young professionals. The app builds upon the notion of making plans via email but creates a simple environment to do so. Users of my app are interested in making plans easily and effectively. For this reason, I provide my users potential meeting locations to help the process. Whether it's a coffee shop, a mall, or a zumba studio, our users are not burdened in connecting with their friends, both online and in person.
