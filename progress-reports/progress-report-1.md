Progress Report 1
================
- I have completed the php section of my application. Can access all of the features of the application, including, adding friends, making events, confirming events. Also, schedules are displayed in the calendar.
- Yes I did. 
- I will now be progressive enhancing the application. I would like two get all three portions, add-event.php, add-friends.php and calendar.php done this week.
- I enjoyed finding solutions to the create calendar function that loops through an event array to display the event.
- It was frustrating(boring), dealing with preg_match function and trying to figure out how to match two patterns at once.
- I didn't have to alter much.
