Progress Report 2
================

- Created an ajax algorithm to get a json object to help searches for friends.
- Yes, need to fix bugs though.
- I need to add the ajax function to the Add-plans page. Fix bugs.
- I learned how to create a json object using php and how to send it to my js and use it with JQueryUI.
- I also learned/came up with a friend request system.
- I really enjoyed trying to figure out how to make a json object. It was satisfying when the autocomplete connected to that object worked.
- Discovering bugs was frustrating. More time!
- I have to radically alter my css to handle lower resolution views.
